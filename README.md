### Hi, I'm Amanda Sharp! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computational Chemist working in material science. I am currently living in Bridgewater, NJ. I recieved my PhD from Virginia Tech in May 2023 and am originally from Northern California. 

My research focuses are on Computational Chemistry. I utilize computational tools and computer programming to explore structure-function relationships for many different molecular types. I've been lucky enough to work on a wide variety of different collaboration projects, supporting researchers all over the country with their research endevors while attending graduate school at Virginia Tech. 

I am always trying to continue my growth in the field and my repositories will reflect that. In the past, I have supported a large research group (typically >15 undergraduate research students each semester), so that will also be reflected in my methodology and detail to how each script works and is ran.

Find me elsewhere! :earth_americas:
